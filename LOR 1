I am writing this letter to give my  recommendation for  Ms. Madhumita Jadhav who is applying for the Masters at your university. During her tenure at college, I was her Machine Learning Professor and IEEE head.  My first encounter with Madhumita was 2 years back when an event was conducted under my supervision, volunteering for which she showed excellent team and management abilities.
I taught her Machine Learning Algorithms. Her grasping, logical and analytical thinking has delighted me always. Madhumita is a talented student with unmatchable problem solving ability. I noticed she was always more interested in practical implementation in lab work rather than theoretical knowledge. She always asks for the real life example and implementation for the algorithms. She was so interested in this field that she learned out of syllabus algorithms as well for the sake of interest and come up to me to ask the examples and real life applications for the same. This lady implemented almost all the algorithms which I taught on the competitions like Kaggle and CrowdAnalytics she used to come at me for clearing her doubts . She is an  astute learner and always impressed me with articulated understanding for the subjects, impressive quality of work and constant vigilance.
